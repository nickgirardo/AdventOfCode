## Thoughts

After a fairly tough puzzle yesterday it feels like we're getting a break with this!

With only 4 total races I was tempted to just use a calculator (which might have ended up being faster) but I decided for consistency's sake to just write this one out in Haskell as well

I suppose the challenge in this one was realizing that the races should be thought of as parabolic arcs, which can be solved with a simple quadratic equation
